# This command measures latency and bandwidth of an internet connection from the command line.
# It uses hosts that participate in speedtest.net.  Output is in the form of a csv file.
# As designed, speedtest.net can be used to test latency and bandwidth only from a browser
# and only then, manually.  I wanted to be able to test latency and bandwidth repeatedly
# via cron, or similar, and to record historical data, so I created this script.  Output
# is to stdout. If I'd have known at the beginning that I'd write this much code, I'd
# have done it in python.

# These are some participating hosts.  If you want to use a host from another location, you will
# have to run the test from your browser and capture headers to determine the correct URL. Or, if
# you are a flash hacker, you can get all of them from the swf file used to implement the test.
# Note that URLs can differ between hosts, so you do need to determine the correct one to use
# on a case by case basis.
#
# urls from here: https://www.speedtestserver.com/
